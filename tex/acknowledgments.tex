I wish to specially thank my advisor, Marcia Groszek, for all her guidance and unending patience.
I have learned much from her thoughtfulness, carefulness, and passion.

I also wish to specially thank Fran\c{c}ois Dorais for the enormous amount of
time that he has spent with me.
I have had many incredibly inspiring and awesome conversations
with him, each of which has taught me so much.

I am grateful for the mathematics department at Dartmouth.
My classmates Jon, Giulio, Geoff, and Matt were all instrumental in my education,
as was the logic group: Marcia, Rebecca, Pete, Joe, Brooke, John, Fran\c{c}ois, and Rachel.

I am also grateful for the many other wonderful mathematicians that I have met along the way.
I learned much during my first year of graduate school from Luke and Liz.
I am thankful for the logic community in general, and especially to Jeff Hirst and Reed Soloman.

I wish to express my gratitude to Tom Dechand for introducing me to
G\"{o}del's Incompleteness Theorem and for getting me excited about mathematics in general.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for all the blessings that they have given me.
I would like to especially thank my grandparents, Frank and Florence, for all their support.
My final thanks are revserved for Erin, the best wife-beans in the world.
